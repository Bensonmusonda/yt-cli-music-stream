### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application.

#### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp rich
```

#### Step 2: Install `yt-dlp`, `mpv`, and `ffmpeg`

These are external command-line tools that your script depends on. You must install them and ensure they are in your system's PATH.

**Windows**

1.  **Download**: Get the executables from their official websites:
      * [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases)
      * [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/)
      * [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2.  **Add to PATH**: Place the downloaded executable files (e.g., `yt-dlp.exe`, `mpv.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`) in a directory that is included in your system's PATH environment variable. A common location is `C:\Windows`.

**macOS**
Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install yt-dlp mpv ffmpeg
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
Install using the `apt` package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp mpv ffmpeg
```
